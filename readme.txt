Alohaâ€”This is the ReadMe for the Psychic Game, which will be modified before shipping. 

For now this will serve as my psuedoCode Board

The instructions are to:

The app randomly picks a letter, the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 

Put the following text on your page:

	Guess what letter I'm thinking of

	Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

		When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

	Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

		When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

	Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

	Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

HTML for communicating to user

	OPTION 1
	<body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-offset-2 col-md-8">
          <div class="jumbotron">
            <h2>You just typed <span id="user-text"><strong>...Nothing.</strong></span></h2>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- We have to put this at the end of our document to ensure the user-text
         span exists when we try to access it. -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Let's start by grabbing a reference to the <span> below.
      var userText = document.getElementById("user-text");

      // Next, we give JavaScript a function to execute when onkeyup event fires.
      document.onkeyup = function(event) {
        userText.textContent = event.key;
        console.log(event);
